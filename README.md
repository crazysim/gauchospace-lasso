# Gauchospace Lasso

This Google Chrome extension is for Gauchospace, a Moodle installation in use
by UCSB students.

It provides five pieces of functionality that I find useful. 

* No more "Your session has timed out.  Please login again.". If the form has
  been autofilled and if that message appears then the extension will
  automatically log you in. 

* Right-Clicking and doing a "Save As..." now works for documents other than
  PDFs. You can now "Save As..." Word, Powerpoint, and probably Excel
  documents. 

* A QuickClick Menu for clicking the course web page you want to get to when
  you go in from the front page of GauchoSpace and it has auto-logged you in.
  I don't see why I have to scroll and click those tinier links at the bottom.
  It is much nicer to have those huge buttons on the left.

* Cloned the current week to the top in the course web page 
  so the current week is right there when you get to the page.

* Fixed left sidebar for course view so you don't lose it when scrolling down.
